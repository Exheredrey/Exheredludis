<h1>Paludis, the Other Package Mangler</h1>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<p>This document describes some of the more commonly encountered problems, issues
and things that aren't bugs but might look like they are. Pestering anyone about
these is liable to get you hurt.</p>

<p>This document also describes some things that are not bugs or missing
functionality. Pestering anyone about these is liable to get you hurt a lot.</p>

<h2>Paludis is Stricter than Portage</h2>

<h3 id="mergingweirdstuff">Merging Weird Stuff</h3>

<p>Paludis will refuse to merge various things:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Device nodes, fifos and similar weird files. Portage will merge these
    incorrectly and then leave stray garbage lying around; Paludis refuses to do
    anything with them. Ebuilds that need to install fancy file types should do
    so in <code>pkg_postinst</code>.</li>

    <li>Things containing spaces. The VDB format, which cannot be changed
    without breaking Portage compatibility, uses spaces as a delimiter. Portage
    behaves incorrectly on items with spaces in the name; Paludis simply refuses
    to touch them.</li>

    <li>Non-directories on top of directories. Paludis will not let a package
    overwrite a directory with a non-directory. This is for your own safety.
    Portage doesn't bail out on this, but instead ends up partially merging
    content and generally making a mess of your system.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="testfailures">Packages Failing <code>src_test</code></h3>

<p>Various packages will fail <code>src_test</code>.</p>

<p>You can <code>export SKIP_FUNCTIONS="test"</code> to skip tests. This
is best done on a per-package basis via <code>bashrc</code>:</p>

<pre>
case "${PN}" in

    # These packages often fail src_test (not a complete list)
    automake|glibc|e2fsprogs|neon|gettext|tar)
        export SKIP_FUNCTIONS=test
        ;;

esac
</pre>

<p>Unfortunately not all package maintainers care about making their package's test
suite work. This is a nuisance, a) because it makes things much harder for arch
teams and b) because it makes it harder for users to catch bugs.</p>

<p>At this stage, you should not consider filing a bug about packages whose test
phases fail. This is something that is being handled by the Gentoo QA team and
various arch teams.</p>

<h3 id="sandboxwithroot">Sandbox Violations when <code>ROOT</code> is Set</h3>

<p>Various packages will give sandbox violations when installing to somewhere
other than <code>/</code>.</p>

<p>Paludis enforces <code>ROOT</code> via Sandbox. However, some packages don't
honour <code>ROOT</code>. To temporarily disable sandbox for these packages,
<code>export SANDBOX_PREDICT=/</code> or <code>export SANDBOX_WRITE=/</code> as
appropriate.</p>

<h2>Undesirable Misfunctionality</h2>

<h3>wget Resume Support</h3>

<p>Non-Problem: With Portage, <code>wget -c</code> is used to attempt to resume
downloads of partial files. With Paludis, resumes are not allowed.</p>

<p>Rationale: This leads to corruption and wasted bandwidth far too frequently.
In particular, if an error page that isn't recognised as a 404 is fetched from
one server (this is common for <code>mirror://sourceforge/</code>), resume
support means <code>wget</code> would then download all but the first few
hundred bytes of the file from somewhere else, leading to a corrupt distfile
notice only after lots of bandwidth has been wasted.</p>

<p>Having said that, if you really want this functionality, you can implement it
using a custom fetcher.</p>

<h3>Build Resume / Skip First Support</h3>

<p>Non-Problem: Paludis doesn't have an equivalent to --resume --skipfirst in
Portage.</p>

<p>Rationale: Too unreliable, too flaky and far too widely abused; however, if
an ebuild exits with an error, Paludis will echo a resume command (<code>paludis
    -i10 =sys-apps/foo-1.23-r1 =app-misc/fnord-2 ...</code>) that can be used to
resume the build.</p>

<h3>No Automatic Niceness Support</h3>

<p>Non-Problem: There's no <code>PORTAGE_NICENESS</code> equivalent.</p>

<p>Rationale: Learn how to use <code>nice</code>. There's no
<code>GCC_NICENESS</code> or <code>VIM_NICENESS</code> either.</p>
