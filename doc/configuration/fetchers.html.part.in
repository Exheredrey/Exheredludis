<h1>Fetchers</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Paludis makes use of scripts called 'fetchers' to do most downloading. Fetchers can be added for additional protocols
(for example, if you need to use a third party ebuild where upstream distributes its sources via Gopher), and built-in
fetchers can be replaced (for example, if you want to use something other than <code>wget</code> to fetch via http).</p>

<h2>Standard Fetchers</h2>

<p>Paludis ships with the following fetcher protocols:</p>

<ul>
###FETCHERS###
</ul>

<h2>User Defined Fetchers</h2>

<p>To write your own fetcher for protocol <code>proto</code>, create an executable script named <code>doproto</code> (the
<code>do</code> prefix is essential) and place it in <code>SHAREDIR/paludis/fetchers/</code>, where <code>SHAREDIR</code>
is probably <code>/usr/share</code>. This directory has priority over the usual Paludis fetcher locations, so it can be
used to override existing fetchers as well as creating new ones.</p>

<p>A fetcher is called with two parameters, the source URI and the destination filename. It indicates success or failure
via its exit status.</p>

<p>For examples, consult the built-in fetchers, which can be found in <code>LIBEXECDIR/paludis/fetchers/</code>.</p>
