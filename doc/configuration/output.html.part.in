<h1>output.conf</h1>

###PALUDISENVIRONMENTONLY###

<p>The <code>output.conf</code> file controls how Paludis handles output from subcommands such as building and
installing a package, or syncing a repository.</p>

<p>There are currently two basic settings that can be set in <code>output.conf</code>:</p>

<pre>
# always_keep_output_logs may be set to 'true' to always keep output logs, even
# if a build succeeds.
always_keep_output_logs = false

# quiet may be set to 'true' to show only messages, rather than all output, when
# carrying out an action.
quiet = false
</pre>
