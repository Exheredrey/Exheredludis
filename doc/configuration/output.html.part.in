###PALUDISENVIRONMENTONLY###

<p><strong>Usually you do not need an <code>output.conf</code> at all.</strong> The defaults are generally fine.</p>

<p>The <code>output.conf</code> file controls how Paludis handles output from subcommands such as building and
installing a package, or syncing a repository. The basic configuration is set in
<code>$SHAREDIR/environments/paludis/default_output.conf</code>, and additional configuration can be specified by the
user in <code>output.conf</code> in the normal configuration directory.</p>

<p>There are currently two basic settings that can be set in <code>output.conf</code>:</p>

<pre>
# always_keep_output_logs may be set to 'true' to always keep output logs, even
# if a build succeeds.
always_keep_output_logs = false

# quiet may be set to 'true' to show only messages, rather than all output, when
# carrying out an action.
quiet = false
</pre>

<p>For more advanced usage, two additional variables allow additional output managers to be specified:

<pre>
# extra_output_loggers may be used to define additional output managers that
# handle normal output.
extra_output_loggers =

# extra_message_loggers may be used to define additional output managers that
# handle messages.
extra_message_loggers =
</pre>

<p>For example, if you wish to send messages to syslog, you could use:</p>

<pre>
extra_message_loggers = my_syslog_messages

[manager my_syslog_messages]
handler = command
stdout_command = logger -t paludis
stderr_command = logger -t paludis
</pre>
