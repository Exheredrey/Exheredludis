<h1>keywords.conf</h1>

###PALUDISENVIRONMENTONLY###

<p>The <code>keywords.conf</code> file controls which keywords are and are not accepted. It is a standard configuration
file which may be a bash file and which may use the <code>keywords.conf.d/</code> directory.</p>

<p>Each line in the file consists of a specification followed by one or more accepted keywords. A specification may be
any of:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The special specification <code>*/*</code>, which matches all packages. Nearly all users will have at least one
    line using this specification.</li>
    <li>A simple <code>category/package</code> name.</li>
    <li>A simple <code>set</code> name.</li>
    <li>A complex dependency specification, which may use the full range of operators supported by Paludis, along with
    <code>:slot</code> and <code>::repository</code> restrictions. Either or both of the category and package parts may
    be an asterisk (but both must be supplied, even if they are).</li>
</ul>

<p>Accepted keywords are one of:</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>keyword</code>, which accepts any package containing that keyword.</li>
    <li><code>~keyword</code>, which accepts any package containing that ~keyword. This does <em>not</em> automatically
    accept the regular, non-tilde keyword.</li>
    <li><code>*</code>, which accepts any package, including one with empty keywords.</li>
    <li><code>-*</code>, which cancels any previously accepted match (see below).</li>
</ul>

<p>Accepted keywords are usually cumulative, so if you have a <code>*/* arch ~arch</code> line, you will need to use
<code>cat/pkg -* arch</code> if you only wish to accept <code>arch</code> for a particular package.</p>
