README for Paludis
==================

Paludis is in the really early prototype not intended for real use stage. If you
aren't comfortable with C++, ebuild internals and Gentoo in general then you
shouldn't be touching it.

Developer documentation is available via 'make doxygen' (you need Doxygen
installed, and having GraphViz will help too). It will be created under
'doc/html/'. User documentation is kept in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet
stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying 'Beware of the
Leopard'.

If you don't feel like building your own docs, see:
