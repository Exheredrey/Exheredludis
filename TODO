System report action: 'paludis --report'
----------------------------------------

Assigned to: <nobody>

  * Shall output a comprehensible and parsable report of the current
    state of the system.

  * The output format shall be suited for sending this report via mail.

  * Shall be made as a task. (See libpaludistasks)

  * Shall contain at least this information:
    - QA warning in regard to installed packages
    - Warning for installed packages which are package.masked
    - Warning for installed packages which are marked vulnerable
      by a GLSA.

Crossdev-like repository
------------------------

Assigned to: Danny van Dyk <kugelfang@gentoo.org>

  * Format is 'cross'.

  * Needs key 'CTARGET'.

  * Category is set to 'cross-${CTARGET}'.

  * Provided packages are:
    - binutils
    - gcc
    - kernel-headers
    - libc

  * Shall support package aliasing:

      libc = >=sys-libs/newlib-1

    This way, cross-${CTARGET}/libc will resolve to >=sys-libs/newlib-1.

  * Unset aliases shall be filled with defaults values, based on the complete
    CTARGET.
