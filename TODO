Crossdev-like repository
------------------------

Assigned to: Danny van Dyk

  * Format is 'cross'.

  * Needs key 'CTARGET'.

  * Category is set to 'cross-${CTARGET}'.

  * Provided packages are:
    - binutils
    - gcc
    - kernel-headers
    - libc

  * Shall support package aliasing:

      libc = >=sys-libs/newlib-1

    This way, cross-${CTARGET}/libc will resolve to >=sys-libs/newlib-1.

  * Unset aliases shall be filled with defaults values, based on the complete
    CTARGET.
