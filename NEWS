News for Paludis
================

This file lists the major changes between versions. For a more detailed list
of every change, see the ChangeLog.

0.32.2:
    * Fixed various compiler issues.

    * ERepository::package_names (and by extension, paludis --list-packages) are
      now quite a bit faster, but may list package names whose package
      directories include no versions.

    * DEFINED_PHASES is now used and supported (but not used for 0-based EAPIs
      with pre-generated cache, since a cache line has yet to be standardised).
      As a result, ebuild hooks for phases that aren't used will not necessarily
      be triggered.

0.32.1:
    * VDB entries not containing an IUSE file would give incorrect behaviour.
    This is now fixed.

0.32.0:
    * accerso now handles unmirrorable files sensibly.

    * sets would sometimes not end up being added to world. This is now fixed.

0.32.0_alpha1:
    * Support for packages that haven't been written yet.

    * --debug-build and --checks are gone, replaced by the special
      build_options: choice that can be configured in a similar way to use
      flags.

    * Clients using NoConfigEnvironment now use --extra-repository-dir (possibly
      multiple times) and --master-repository-name rather than
      --master-repository-dir.

    * The contrarius client has been removed.

    * metadata.xml support.

0.30.3:
    * 0.30.2 would fail tests on some systems due to relative path issues.
      This is now fixed.

0.30.2:
    * Work around ebuilds that treat cwd as secure.

0.30.1:
    * EAPI 2 support.

0.30.0:
    * Paludis no longer includes wrappers for GNU awk, make, patch, and sed.
      Users of systems where the default versions are not the GNU versions
      must use PATH manipulation or aliases in /etc/paludis/bashrc to ensure
      that the GNU versions are used.  (This is not necessary on typical Linux
      systems; check <command> --version if in doubt.)

    * Support for from- and in- repository deps.

    * Wildcards are now allowed for paludis --query, --uninstall, --install.

    * Unavailable format repositories are now documented and built by default.

0.28.0:
    * Compilers without tr1 memory, type traits and functional support are no
      longer supported. This means you, gcc-3.

    * Support for the Exherbo distribution.

    * Better detection of SCM versions.

    * bug fixes: pkg_pretend now behaves correctly with resumes (ticket:604).
      Better support for Portage config files (ticket:597). Package dep spec
      parsing no longer has trailing hyphen issues (ticket:590).

    * New Selection + Filter + Generator interface using Environment, replacing
      the old PackageDatabase Query (ticket:559).

    * importare can now change file ownership to root (ticket:599).

0.26.2:

    * Bug fixes: importare now really adds packages to world by default, as
      promised in 0.26.0_pre3.  pkg_pretend is now properly fatal (ticket:579).
      There are no longer bogus 'use flags defined recursively' messages
      (ticket:568).  Symlink rewriting now works when builddir contains symlinks
      (ticket:571).  The dreaded Ruby bindings segfaults are fixed (ticket:558).

    * The Ruby bindings have been extended somewhat.

0.26.1:
    * Bug fix: if we install a directory using rename(), call utime() on all
      file children.

0.26.0:
    * Fixed gcc-3.4 compile.

0.26.0_pre4:
    * portage_compatible in environment.conf is deprecated in favour of the new,
      more fine-grained accept_breaks_portage.  When using Portage configuration
      files, this is also supported as PALUDIS_IGNORE_BREAKS_PORTAGE in
      make.conf, for the convenience of users who prefer to use
      Portage-compatible configuration files without caring about Portage
      compatibility.

    * Extended attributes are now preserved when merging, where supported.

    * paludis now supports syncing from bzr repositories.

0.26.0_pre3:
    * reconcilio no longer accepts the --verbose switch; verbose display is
      now turned on unconditionally.

    * env->query_use(...) now issues a QA notice and returns false for E
      repository IDs when the flag isn't in IUSE / USE_EXPAND / arch.list.

    * importare now adds packages to the world file unless the --preserve-world
      option is specified; any packages previously installed with importare
      should be added manually if appropriate.  The special "ununused" set no
      longer exists.

    * If 'foo' is a user defined set, we automatically create 'foo*' which is
      like 'foo' but with all operators treated as '*' recursively.

0.26.0_pre2:
    * paludis now supports ${root} in environment.conf.  This can be
      used when defining the "world" key, so that the configuration
      works when the filesystem is mounted as a chroot as a separate
      directory.

    * Set names can now be specified in .conf-style set files.

    * Sets can now contain ?: entries, which are like ? entries but also
      consider the slot part of the dependency specification.

    * We no longer issue a QA warning for E repository profiles that attempt to
      remove the same line more than once from a parent profile's files.

0.26.0_pre1:
    * paludis now rebuilds the VDB names and provides caches
      incrementally after each install and uninstall. This can give a
      significant speed-up, but it makes it more important to run
      paludis --regenerate-installed-cache after installing or
      removing a package with portage, as this will no longer be done
      automatically.

      This also changes the format of the provides cache, so you will need
      to run paludis --regenerate-installed-cache once after upgrading.

    * paludis now uses ${builddir}/${CATEGORY}-${PF} instead of
      ${builddir}/${CATEGORY}/${PF} as a temporary build directory.

0.26.0_alpha14:
    * paludis now has an --executables option which shows all executables
      installed by a package that are in $PATH.

    * paludis --info pkg now shows information about all installed matches and
      the best installable match by default.

    * Installation details for pretend_resume demo hook have changed. Please
      remove any old symlinks and see the comments at the start of the file
      for new instructions.

0.26.0_alpha13:
    * World is now handled by environment, not individual repositories. Consult
      the FAQ 'Upgrades' section for migration instructions.

    * All ruby demos are now installed with the executable bit set, and a
      symlink for playman is installed in $(bindir).

    * importare now has an --install-under option.

    * Added two new hook phases, install_task_execute_pre and
      install_task_execute_post, to avoid issues with continue-on-failure.

    * Hooks in the auto/ directory can now specify in which phase or phases they
      are to be run.

0.26.0_alpha12:
    * The merger is able to detect hardlinks and tries to merge them as such.

    * We're even less strict about environment checking from VDB, to avoid
      issues with packages installed several years ago when USE_EXPAND didn't
      include KERNEL etc.

    * Fixed a quoting bug that would result in unwanted wildcard expansion
      when rewriting *DEPEND values.

0.26.0_alpha11:
    * paludis --owner now shows matching files when --full-match is not
      specified.

    * importare now does stripping the same way as E repositories, based upon
      the --debug-build argument.

    * We are less strict when doing environment checking when loading an entry
      from VDB, to avoid issues with some Portage versions not setting certain
      variables.

0.26.0_alpha10:
    * rsync based syncers (rsync://, file://, tar+http:// and tar+ftp://) now
      support --exclude in sync_options, as well as --exclude-from.

    * Set names are now supported in package_mask.conf and package_unmask.conf.

    * Experimental new Exndbam repository, which can replace VDB on systems that
      don't use Gentoo trees.

    * In various places we now sort by i-node rather than filename when doing
      directory recursion. This gives substantial i/o improvements.

0.26.0_alpha9:
    * Recent Portage unpacks lzma files, in violation of PMS and without any way
      of ebuilds being able to check for this behaviour. We now emulate this
      stupidity.

    * Work around tr1::shared_ptr<> not being usable with a tr1::mem_fn when
      using boost.

    * Work around various ICC oddities.

0.26.0_alpha8:
    * Playman is now an "official" ruby demo script.

    * Various Ruby updates.

    * Various QA updates.

    * Sending Paludis a SIGINT or SIGTERM whilst it has children active will no
      longer lock.

    * Linux appears to randomly nuke set*id bits when doing a rename(). We now
      work around this.

0.26.0_alpha7:
    * New demo hook, pretend_resume.bash, to print the resume command
      at the end of the --install --pretend display.

    * dohtml fixed.

0.26.0_alpha6:
    * Various merger bug fixes.

    * Various Ruby updates.

    * Various QA updates.

    * Uninstalling packages installed with recent Portage no longer breaks.

0.26.0_alpha5:
    * STILL BROKEN, wait for 0.26.0 if you use these: CRAN, Ruby bindings for
      dep list.

    * Various switches now support --no-, for negation.

    * paludis, inquisitio --show-authors.

    * {keywords,licenses,use}.conf can now contain single- or double- quoted
      tokens.

    * paludis --install --pretend will show how many bytes still need to be
      downloaded for a given package to be installed. Two new metadata keys,
      size_of_download_required and size_of_all_distfiles, have been added.

    * Some merger improvements were implemented: try to merge by renaming a
      parent directory or merging each file separately. If a copy is needed,
      merge to a temporary file and then rename to the real destination.

    * Symlink rewriting is now part of the merger and is EAPI-configurable. All
      EAPIs known to paludis allow symlink rewriting except exheres-0.

    * Rather than spawning a second paludis instance, has_version etc in ebuilds
      now communicate back to the original Paludis process through a pipe.

    * Paludis will now work with Bash 3.2_p20 and later (gentoo#190128).

0.26.0_alpha4:
    * STILL BROKEN, wait for 0.26.0 if you use these: CRAN, Ruby bindings for
      dep specs.

    * inquisitio --all-versions, --not, --compact.

    * paludis, reconcilio, importare --compact, --show-package-descriptions.

    * New defaults: --debug-build split, --dl-blocks
      accumulate, --dl-override-masks tilde-keyword license (and use 'none' to
      ignore defaults), --show-reasons summary, --show-use-descriptions changed,
      --show-package-descriptions new, --dl-downgrade warning

    * Paludis now protects further against sandbox clobbering the PATH.

    * Metadata options for importare.

    * adjutrix, qualudis and friends ignore --master-repository-dir if
      it is the same as the main repository directory, allowing it to
      be more usefully specified in {ADJUTRIX,QUALUDIS}_OPTIONS.

    * Various API documentation improvements.

0.26.0_alpha3:
    * STILL BROKEN, wait for 0.26.0 if you use these: CRAN, Ruby bindings for
      dep specs.

    * More verbose paludis --info output.

    * Paludis now fully supports filenames containing spaces.

    * New, much more flexible, faster inquisitio.

    * paludis --continue-on-failure if-independent implemented.

    * libebt, libwrapiter no longer used.

    * Bug fixes: --dl-deps-default works again. More
      robustness/compilance improvements for reconcilio, including
      proper handling of ELF files that use the non-native byte order.
      --show-use-descriptions works as in 0.24 for new packages.

0.26.0_alpha2:
    * STILL BROKEN, wait for 0.26.0 if you use these: CRAN, Ruby bindings for
      dep specs.

    * If a wrong package or repository name is used in several places, they will
      give possible suggestions rather than just saying "could not find
      whatever".

    * More documentation for clients.

    * User-defined package sets are now cached.

    * Bug fixes: reconcilio is better at handling broken elf files. Doxygen
      external tags are fixed. IUSE in VDB has +/- stripped.

0.26.0_alpha1:
    * STILL BROKEN, wait for 0.26.0 if you use these: CRAN, Ruby bindings for
      dep specs.

    * We now ship Python bindings (Google Summer of Code project by Piotr
      Jaroszyński).

    * Massive internals changes. The old PDE / VM system has been replaced by
      PackageIDs.

    * GCC 4.1+ users can now --enable-visibility to enable .so visibility
      attributes.

    * EAPI 1 is supported.

    * Support for .so and Python hooks.

    * New distribution configuration system, allowing distributions to change
      various aspects of default behaviour.

    * Compiling against Paludis is now done via pkg-config.

    * Huge documentation rework.

    * Unsafe uninstalls now require 'paludis --permit-unsafe-uninstalls'.

    * Manifest2 support, replacing digest support.

    * Whether src_test is run is now an EAPI defined default. 'paludis --checks
      none|default|always' can be used to change this. SKIP_FUNCTIONS voodoo is
      now considered harmful.

    * New clients: accerso (for running a distfiles mirror), instruo (for
      generating metadata cache), reconcilio (like revdep-rebuild), importare
      (for managing unpackaged packages).

    * Initial 'paludis --continue-on-failure' support.

    * Much nicer 'paludis --info', and pkg_info support.

0.24.6:
    * Various bugfixes: ebuild_notice is now called correctly by various
      utilities. Exit statuses for programs dying with a signal are now detected
      correctly.

    * g++-4.2's std::exception::what() is less useful. We now use typeid.name()
      to get the type of an exception for error messages.

    * configure now checks for more CXXFLAGS that are known to cause breakages.

    * We now include test cases for hooks. This means eselect modules are now
      strict build dependencies.

0.24.5:
    * More ldconfig oddities fixed.

    * The eselect news module is no longer shipped as part of Paludis.

0.24.4:
    * The ldconfig check introduced in 0.24.3 would incorrectly detect a BSD
      ldconfig on some GNU systems. This is now fixed.

0.24.3:
    * Bug fix: -* in keywords.conf now works.

    * Non-GNU ldconfig is now supported.

    * Various minor bug fixes and docs updates.

0.24.2:
    * Various fixes for FreeBSD, gcc 3.4.

    * Recursively defined USE flags no longer cause problems.

0.24.1:
    * Switched to automake-1.10 for BSD friendliness.

    * Dist tarballs no longer have issues with missing Vim scripts.

0.24.0:
    * Ranged dependencies using foo/bar[>=1&<2] or foo/bar[=1|=2] are now
    allowed. An asterisk can now be used for the category and / or package part
    of a dependency specification in places where it makes sense. Use of '*' in
    keywords.conf, use.conf, licenses.conf is deprecated in favour of '*/*'.

    * PMS r163 compliant version specifications.

    * Stricter in various places: ebuilds that attempt to use non-invariant
    SLOTs will now be caught, version spec compliance is enforced, more profile
    sanity checks.

    * New Vim syntax highlighting scripts.

    * New --dl-reinstall-targets option for paludis.

    * Configuration and set files can now be dynamically generated using bash
    scripts.

    * New .hook format for hooks, allowing control over execution order.

    * Better handling of dependency resolution when a virtual is provided by
    multiple packages.

    * --add-to-world-spec no longer requires 'XXXXXX'. If not present, mkstemp
    will not be used to generate the filename.

    * Symlinks are now permitted in Ebuild repositories as per PMS.

    * Various Environment-related internals changes giving cleaner code.

0.22.2:
    * Partial, highly experimental support for Portage format configuration
    files (paludis -E portage).

    * Better error and warning messages and increased error tolerance in
    various places.

    * User hooks are now run with prefixed output to make it clear what is
    running.

    * There is no longer any need to explicitly export variables in bashrc etc.

    * Manual pages now indicate default values for options.

    * Bugfix: getgrgid returning NULL no longer causes problems.

    * Bugfix: cleaning up working directories is no longer done with userpriv.

0.22.1:
    * Bugfix: pkg_setup will no longer be run with userpriv.

    * Bugfix: line continuations in configuration files work properly now.

    * Bugfix: buildroot is no longer created automatically, so it won't have
    inappropriate permissions.

0.22.0:
    * Ability to drop privileges when building. Paludis now expects distfiles
    and buildroot directories to be owned by the group 'paludisbuild'.

    * Dynamic environment loading: --config-suffix foo is deprecated in favour
    of --environment :foo.

    * Various PMS compliance fixes.

0.20.2:
    * Various bug fixes, most notably ncurses should now be upgradable.

0.20.1:
    * Bug fix: variables from saved environments would sometimes not be exported
    to helper programs due to a 'feature' of declare -x in bash.

0.20.0:
    * Merging is now handled by the destination repository. The new merger
    code does a two pass merge to catch most errors before the filesystem
    is modified. New merger hooks allow for much more flexibility.

    * Hooks returning non-zero will now usually cause an abort rather than
    a warning.

    * Various new QA checks.

    * Lots of internal code cleanups.

0.18.1:
    * use.conf etc now automatically includes use.conf.d/*.conf.

    * New configuration key for ebuild repositories, master_repository. If set,
    the specified repository will be used as a 'master' for profiles/, eclasses,
    PORTDIR etc.

    * qualudis now supports --master-repository-dir for checking of
    non-standalone repositories.

    * Compile fixes for g++-3.4, g++-4.2, selinux.

0.18.0:
    * Huge code cleanup. If your compiler does not implement tr1, you will now
    need boost installed.

    * Much faster adjutrix --what-needs-keywording when the system set includes
    blocks.

    * New client, inquisitio, for searching.

    * Sets can now appear in world, and can be uninstalled.

    * Support post-install configuration via paludis --config.

    * Write cache is now cleared after a sync.

    * The repository name is now appended to the names_cache path. When
    upgrading, you will be told to manually remove any old names_cache files.

    * A bug with overwriting stale symlinks with objects has been fixed.

0.16.2:
    * Defaults for repository conf files can now be specified via
    repository_defaults.conf.

    * Hooks can now determine which client is being used via the PALUDIS_CLIENT
    environment variable.

    * For unmerging, VDB parsing of Portage-generated entries is less strict.

    * Various bug fixes.

0.16.1:
    * 0.16.0 had a bug that would cause blocks to be reported incorrectly for
    certain virtuals. This is now fixed.

    * paludis --list-* now supports a --repository-format option for
    restricting output.

    * g++-3.4 ships with broken iterators. We now work around this.

0.16.0:
    * Enhanced DepList. Most blocks are now shown as errors in the list.
    Suggested dependencies are now supported. Paludis can continue resolving
    dependencies when encountering a masked package, and show a summary of
    everything that needs to be unmasked as part of the output. Post
    dependencies can now be installed much later on if necessary to resolve
    cycles. Deps in the form || ( a =b-2 ) where b-1 is installed are handled
    more elegantly. Deps in the form || ( =a-1 =a-2 ) are rewritten to a single
    package dependency. Blockers are now handled correctly. Downgrades are now
    user controllable.

    * New adjutrix --what-needs-keywording action, for use by arch and security
    teams to obtain a full list of what would need to be keyworded to mark a
    target to a particular keyword level.

    * In repository configurations, format=portage is deprecated in favour of
    format=ebuild, and format=nothing is deprecated in favour of hooks.

    * A bug whereby Paludis would sometimes use the default virtual provider
    even when an alternate virtual provider is installed is fixed.

    * We now work around a sandbox 'feature' that results in PATH being
    clobbered. This fixes build issues with openoffice, dev86 and probably
    others.

    * Emulate Portage's silly and highly limited hooks system so that
    misbehaving Java ebuilds still work. Users should not use these hooks for
    anything.

    * Syncers are now pluggable. Syncing via darcs and tar+http is now possible.
    Syncers can now take various options via the sync_options key (use
    --list-sync-protocols for a list), and sync_exclude is deprecated. Multiple
    syncers can be specifed, in which case later syncers are used as a fallback.

    * Paludis now has a logo.

0.14.3:
    * Updated zsh completion

    * The QA metadata check now handles the cached dtd properly.

    * Packages that were updated inconsistently by Portage can now be
    uninstalled without strange errors.

    * Hooks now have access to the parsed commandline via various environment
    variables.

0.14.2:
    * Various performance tweaks.

    * keywords.conf can now use * to accept packages that brokenly set only "-*"
    in KEYWORDS.

    * Installing and uninstalling set*id files is now done differently to
    prevent exploitation of supposedly uninstalled vulnerable applications.

    * Profile incremental variables are now handled in compliance with the
    current PMS draft.

    * Various extensions to the Ruby interface.

0.14.1:
    * Versions can include -rx.y, -rx.y.z etc.

    * Paludis can now be told to pull in new slots only where really necessary,
    via --dl-new-slots as-needed. This must be used in conjunction with the
    existing --dl-upgrade.

    * Paludis can now uninstall all versions of a package by --uninstall
    --all-versions.

    * Paludis now supports resuming of interrupted downloads. Consult the FAQ
    for how to use this.

    * --show-install-reasons is now called --show-reasons.

    * qualudis now supports --archs and --exclude-archs.

    * Documentation on sets and hooks is now provided.

    * Set names can now be used for the atom column in use.conf, keywords.conf,
    licenses.conf, package_unmask.conf, package_mask.conf.  use.conf and
    licenses.conf atomed entries can now override less specific entries'
    contents by using "-*".

    * The adjutrix keywords graph now indicates unused packages visually.

0.14.0:
    * The merge and unmerge utilities are now called with an explicit path.

    * The documentation has been tidied up and extended. Documentation for
    the Ruby interface is now available.

    * paludis --report now also reports unused packages.

    * Various demonstration hooks (show new packages after a sync,
    run report automatically after a sync, enhanced elog message logging)
    are now included.

    * Support for ranged dep atoms and the ~> version operator is now
    available.

    * QA now checks package visibility and profiles. The various QA blacklists
    are now in text files rather than hard coded.

    * A new client for handling cross toolchains, contrarius, is supplied.

    * Completion for ZSH is now available.

    * CVS can now be used in sync keys for repositories.

    * The paludis client can now display a description of USE flags shown
    in a --install --pretend session. The --dl-deps-default parameter can
    be used to specify default values for all six dependency classes.

    * Various icc and BSD portability fixes.

    * The uninstall_ hooks are now called only for real uninstalls. When
    cleaning a package, clean_ is used instead.

    * Paludis handles upgrading itself much more elegantly.

0.12.0:
    * The QA library now has a Ruby interface.

    * Huge performance increases for various common tasks, assisted by optional
    new cache methods. This requires changes to repository files (documented in
    CacheFiles.html).

    * Packages named -live are now recognised as SCM packages.

0.10.1:
    * Package origins and install times can now be queried.

    * Packages with version 9999, or with names ending in "-cvs" or "-svn", are
    now considered to be SCM packages for reinstall purposes.

    * Paludis will now compile with g++-3.4 again.

    * A new --report action, which displays warnings about installed packages
    that are insecure, masked or no longer available, has been added to the
    paludis client.

0.10.0:
    * Uninstall with dependencies and uninstalling unused packages is now
    supported.

    * SCM (CVS, subversion, ...) packages can now be flagged for reinstall after
    a given period of time.

    * Paludis now has options for automatically making debug or split debug
    builds.

    * The resume command can now be written to a file.

    * Cache can be written to a named directory.

    * Various ebuild compatibility tweaks.

    * When to fall back to installed packages to resolve a dependency is now
    configurable.

    * Users can define their own fetchers.

0.8.4:
    * With 0.8.3, 'make doxygen' at top level would fail. This is now fixed.

0.8.3:
    * More work on the Ruby interface.

    * paludis --query now always shows SLOT information.

    * qualudis now has a --quiet option and checks for certain illegal variable
    assignments.

    * Old-style virtual packages are no longer displayed in dep lists.

    * Bash 3.2's different =~ syntax is now supported.

    * PALUDIS_OPTIONS now only applies to paludis. ADJUTRIX_OPTIONS etc can be
    used for other clients.

0.8.2:
    * Lots of documentation updates. A new "Programming with Paludis" document
    is available.

    * NoConfigEnvironment, and by extension adjutrix, can now work with VDB
    repositories where appropriate.

    * More work on the Ruby interface.

    * Various minor Portage compatibility tweaks.

0.8.1:
    * Various autotools-related bugs are fixed. The Ruby Paludis.so should now
    be built and installed correctly on most systems.

    * A -blah in profile files now removes all blah lines, rather than just the
    first.

    * Pre-0.8 command line options are now available again, marked as
    deprecated.

0.8.0:
    * A Ruby interface is now available.

    * qualudis: Various deprecated functions are flagged. Maintainer
    information is now included in the output.

    * The deplist has been rewritten to be much cleaner and much more sensible
    in its handling of virtuals. It can now reinstall packages if USE flags have
    changed, and can display why a package is being installed.

    * The security set for Portage format repositories no longer requires an
    external preprocessor. paludis -pi security will now work off a raw sync.

0.6.7:
    * The qualudis client now checks that Manifest files are signed.

    * Various minor bug fixes.

    * We now define a PKGMANAGER environment variable and vdb entry.

0.6.6:
    * Using * -* in use.conf no longer implies -* for USE_EXPAND variables.

    * A new NoConfigEnvironment is provided to make things easier for tool
    writers.

    that can be used to resume the current task.

0.6.4:
    * A bug that could cause highly strange behaviour with virtuals when using
    multiple profiles is fixed.

    * All package sets are now composite. Previously some were instead selected
    from only one repository, which was confusing behaviour and not as useful as
    originally suspected.

0.6.3:
    * -* now works properly.

    * The adjutrix keywords graph is now SLOT aware.

0.6.2:
    * A bug preventing recursion from behaving correctly in dohtml is fixed.

    * Ebuild hooks can now use 'die'.

    * The eselect news client has several new options.

    * Portage doesn't always add a newline to the last line in world. We now
    work around this.

    * use.conf now supports -*, to prevent inheriting profile defaults.

    * CONFIG_PROTECT and CONFIG_PROTECT_MASK now recognise -target and -*.

    * The adjutrix client has several new actions that will be of use to arch
    and release teams.

0.6.1:
    * A bug in dosym is fixed, meaning that Java packages, amongst others, can
    now be installed.

    * Profile package.mask files can now remove entries from inherited profiles.

    * libdir is now set properly by econf when an ebuild specifies --prefix.
    This should fix installing of KDE, amongst others.

    * Virtuals are now handled entirely dynamically and are not written to vdb.

    * Support for CRAN (the Comprehensive R Archive Network) repositories is now
    available.

    * Manual (man) pages are now provided.

    * Logic for complex operations such as installing and uninstalling has been
    moved out of the client code and into separate task classes.

    * Repository formats are now dynamically loaded from .so files rather than
    being compiled in.

    * libwrapiter is now used to simplify iterator interfaces and reduce compile
    times.

    * Much better handling of Portage-generated VDB entries.

    * For VDB repository entries, all USE flags are marked as masked / forced.

    * --query on virtuals is more useful. USE flags are displayed for --query.
    Sets can be shown with --query.

    * New client: adjutrix, a tool for developers and arch teams.

0.4.4:
    * In key/value configuration files, line continuations inside a quoted
    string with no backslash is now a warning, not an error.

    * REAL_CHOST is now exported automatically, to avoid problems with
    gcc-config when Portage is not installed.

    * Support for newer libselinux /proc voodoo.

    * svn+https:// is recognised for syncing.

    * Huge speed improvements when merging.

    * portageq vdb_path is now emulated.

    * Fail hooks for ebuild phases are available.

0.4.3:
    * An infinite loop on unmerge bug has been fixed.

0.4.2:
    * CONFIG_PROTECT now works as expected for ROOT=/.

    * Unmerging Portage-installed packages with ROOT=/ will no longer have
    strange eclass issues.

0.4.1:
    * Unmerging Portage-installed packages with ROOT=/ will no longer trigger
    sandbox problems.

    * Category names can now include dot characters (crossdev requires this for
    some CHOST values).

    * Use of colour is more consistent.

    * Lots of doxygen and code cleanup.

0.4.0:
    * Lots of internal code cleanup.

    * Doxygen generated documentation is much cleaner. Documentation about
    configuration file formats is now provided.

    * The build directory for Portage format repositories is now configurable
    using a parameter named 'buildroot'.

    * --pretend --install now displays detailed counts ('1 upgrade, 3 new')
    rather than just a raw number. USE_EXPAND flags are displayed in a much
    more useful manner.

    * As part of the test suite, various full installs of test packages are
    now performed.

    * Multiple eclass directories and multiple profile directories can now
    be specified for Portage format repositories. The 'eclassdir' and
    'profiledir' keys are now deprecated in favour of 'eclassdirs' and
    'profiledirs'.

    * New commandline options: --list-vulnerabilities, mostly for use by
    tree maintainers; --dl-no-unnecessary-upgrades, for avoiding upgrades of
    dependencies; --environment-variable which can be used to print
    the value of an environment variable for an installed or uninstalled
    package; similarly, --configuration-variable can be used to get a repository
    configuration variable; --info, as per portage.

    * A new repository format named "nothing" is available. It does not
    contain any packages, but supports a sync parameter to make automatically
    syncing other directories simpler.

    * Fetching is now handled via wrapper scripts. Support for file:/// URLs
    has been added.

    * If the user mirrors.conf file contains an entry with a mirror named '*',
    first try fetching everything from that location.

    * A warning is now emitted when dropping circular dependencies.

    * The merge / unmerge code is now written in C++ rather than bash, and the
    MD5 implementation is now internal rather than relying upon 'md5sum', which
    works around problems when upgrading libc. When upgrading and downgrading,
    sh breakages due to library version changes are less likely to be a problem.

    * xterm titles are now updated for syncing, similar to previous behaviour
    for installing.

    * Syncing via Subversion over HTTP (svn+http://) has been enabled.

    * Improved Portage compatibility: .tar.Z files are now unpacked correctly;
    the 'date' command in ebuild global scope now works with a warning, rather
    than being a hard failure; use of * with operators other than equals in dep
    atoms is now a QA warning rather than a fatal error; PVR and AA are
    supported, and A and AA do not include extra whitespace; dosym now calls
    dodir as necessary as per Portage 2.1; elog is available.

    * Some log messages include program context, to make finding the cause
    of the problem simpler.

    * The repository whence a package originates is saved in VDB. Portage
    compatible environment saving is now used. VDB_FORMAT is now "paludis-2".

    * SELinux is supported.

    * Backtraces are now displayed from 'die'.

    * World file updates are now carried out for packages that are unrestricted
    except where --preserve-world is specified, regardless of whether the
    package was previously installed. World updates are carried out after
    packages are installed rather than before.

    * Dependency errors due to [use] requirements now have more friendly error
    messages.

0.2.5:
    * Syncing via Git is possible (git://, git+http://, git+ssh://).

    * A new mirrors.conf configuration file can be used by the user to specify
    favourite mirrors. It has the same format as thirdpartymirrors from the
    repository.

    * Error condition handling is improved in many places.

    * Versions can now include -try.

    * Initial work towards FreeBSD support has been started.

0.2.4:
    * An ebuild metadata generation bug has been fixed.

    * Added support for repository-level global and per-package USE forcing.

    * Added --repository, --category, and --package filter options for --list
      actions.

    * Added an eselect-based newsreader. Paludis now provides a reference
      implementation of GLEP 42.

    * Various bugfixes -- reinstalling glibc and coreutils should work now,
      amongst others.

0.2.2:
    * Deplist tags are now used for all package sets.

    * The --query output now includes a key explaining the mask symbols.

    * The hook script interface has been enhanced. A hook script for logging
      important actions to paludis.log is included.

    * The --best-version output no longer includes the ::repository suffix.

    * VDB reading is more tolerant of missing and malformed files.

    * Using --query on a package set produces a better error.

    * Ebuilds using fetch restrict will now have pkg_nofetch called where
      appropriate.

0.2.0:
    * Initial public release.
