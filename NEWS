News for Paludis
================

This file lists the major changes between versions. For a more detailed list
of every change, see the ChangeLog.

0.6.2:
    * A bug preventing recursion from behaving correctly in dohtml is fixed.

    * Ebuild hooks can now use 'die'.

    * The eselect news client has several new options.

    * Portage doesn't always add a newline to the last line in world. We now
    work around this.

    * use.conf now supports -*, to prevent inheriting profile defaults.

    * CONFIG_PROTECT and CONFIG_PROTECT_MASK now recognise -target and -*.

    * The adjutrix client has several new actions that will be of use to arch
    and release teams.

0.6.1:
    * A bug in dosym is fixed, meaning that Java packages, amongst others, can
    now be installed.

    * Profile package.mask files can now remove entries from inherited profiles.

    * libdir is now set properly by econf when an ebuild specifies --prefix.
    This should fix installing of KDE, amongst others.

    * More sanity checking is now done both of the build environment and at
    runtime.

0.6.0:
    * elog will now write to PALUDIS_ELOG_FILE, if defined, as well as
    displaying on screen.

    * Virtuals are now handled entirely dynamically and are not written to vdb.

    * Support for CRAN (the Comprehensive R Archive Network) repositories is now
    available.

    * Manual (man) pages are now provided.

    * Logic for complex operations such as installing and uninstalling has been
    moved out of the client code and into separate task classes.

    * Repository formats are now dynamically loaded from .so files rather than
    being compiled in.

    * libwrapiter is now used to simplify iterator interfaces and reduce compile
    times.

    * Much better handling of Portage-generated VDB entries.

    * For VDB repository entries, all USE flags are marked as masked / forced.

    * --query on virtuals is more useful. USE flags are displayed for --query.
    Sets can be shown with --query.

    * New client: adjutrix, a tool for developers and arch teams.

0.4.4:
    * In key/value configuration files, line continuations inside a quoted
    string with no backslash is now a warning, not an error.

    * REAL_CHOST is now exported automatically, to avoid problems with
    gcc-config when Portage is not installed.

    * Support for newer libselinux /proc voodoo.

    * svn+https:// is recognised for syncing.

    * Huge speed improvements when merging.

    * portageq vdb_path is now emulated.

    * Fail hooks for ebuild phases are available.

0.4.3:
    * An infinite loop on unmerge bug has been fixed.

0.4.2:
    * CONFIG_PROTECT now works as expected for ROOT=/.

    * Unmerging Portage-installed packages with ROOT=/ will no longer have
    strange eclass issues.

0.4.1:
    * Unmerging Portage-installed packages with ROOT=/ will no longer trigger
    sandbox problems.

    * Category names can now include dot characters (crossdev requires this for
    some CHOST values).

    * Use of colour is more consistent.

    * Lots of doxygen and code cleanup.

0.4.0:
    * Lots of internal code cleanup.

    * Doxygen generated documentation is much cleaner. Documentation about
    configuration file formats is now provided.

    * The build directory for Portage format repositories is now configurable
    using a parameter named 'buildroot'.

    * --pretend --install now displays detailed counts ('1 upgrade, 3 new')
    rather than just a raw number. USE_EXPAND flags are displayed in a much
    more useful manner.

    * As part of the test suite, various full installs of test packages are
    now performed.

    * Multiple eclass directories and multiple profile directories can now
    be specified for Portage format repositories. The 'eclassdir' and
    'profiledir' keys are now deprecated in favour of 'eclassdirs' and
    'profiledirs'.

    * New commandline options: --list-vulnerabilities, mostly for use by
    tree maintainers; --dl-no-unnecessary-upgrades, for avoiding upgrades of
    dependencies; --environment-variable which can be used to print
    the value of an environment variable for an installed or uninstalled
    package; similarly, --configuration-variable can be used to get a repository
    configuration variable; --info, as per portage.

    * A new repository format named "nothing" is available. It does not
    contain any packages, but supports a sync parameter to make automatically
    syncing other directories simpler.

    * Fetching is now handled via wrapper scripts. Support for file:/// URLs
    has been added.

    * If the user mirrors.conf file contains an entry with a mirror named '*',
    first try fetching everything from that location.

    * A warning is now emitted when dropping circular dependencies.

    * The merge / unmerge code is now written in C++ rather than bash, and the
    MD5 implementation is now internal rather than relying upon 'md5sum', which
    works around problems when upgrading libc. When upgrading and downgrading,
    sh breakages due to library version changes are less likely to be a problem.

    * xterm titles are now updated for syncing, similar to previous behaviour
    for installing.

    * Syncing via Subversion over HTTP (svn+http://) has been enabled.

    * Improved Portage compatibility: .tar.Z files are now unpacked correctly;
    the 'date' command in ebuild global scope now works with a warning, rather
    than being a hard failure; use of * with operators other than equals in dep
    atoms is now a QA warning rather than a fatal error; PVR and AA are
    supported, and A and AA do not include extra whitespace; dosym now calls
    dodir as necessary as per Portage 2.1; elog is available.

    * Some log messages include program context, to make finding the cause
    of the problem simpler.

    * The repository whence a package originates is saved in VDB. Portage
    compatible environment saving is now used. VDB_FORMAT is now "paludis-2".

    * SELinux is supported.

    * Backtraces are now displayed from 'die'.

    * World file updates are now carried out for packages that are unrestricted
    except where --preserve-world is specified, regardless of whether the
    package was previously installed. World updates are carried out after
    packages are installed rather than before.

    * Dependency errors due to [use] requirements now have more friendly error
    messages.

0.2.5:
    * Syncing via Git is possible (git://, git+http://, git+ssh://).

    * A new mirrors.conf configuration file can be used by the user to specify
    favourite mirrors. It has the same format as thirdpartymirrors from the
    repository.

    * Error condition handling is improved in many places.

    * Versions can now include -try.

    * Initial work towards FreeBSD support has been started.

0.2.4:
    * An ebuild metadata generation bug has been fixed.

    * For Portage format repositories, the location of security advisories is
    now a configuration option.

0.2.3:
    * Added support for repository-level global and per-package USE forcing.

    * Added --repository, --category, and --package filter options for --list
      actions.

    * Added an eselect-based newsreader. Paludis now provides a reference
      implementation of GLEP 42.

    * Various bugfixes -- reinstalling glibc and coreutils should work now,
      amongst others.

0.2.2:
    * Deplist tags are now used for all package sets.

    * The --query output now includes a key explaining the mask symbols.

    * News items can now be delivered via repositories (GLEP 42).

    * Various sandbox issues have been fixed.

    * Various bugfixes.

0.2.1:
    * Build issues caused by trying to invoke sandbox from inside sandbox have
      been fixed.

    * The value of EAPI is now shown in the --install mask reasons.

    * User and repository defined package sets are supported.

    * The hook script interface has been enhanced. A hook script for logging
      important actions to paludis.log is included.

    * The --best-version output no longer includes the ::repository suffix.

    * VDB reading is more tolerant of missing and malformed files.

    * Using --query on a package set produces a better error.

    * Ebuilds using fetch restrict will now have pkg_nofetch called where
      appropriate.

0.2.0:
    Initial public release.
