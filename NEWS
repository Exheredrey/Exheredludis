News for Paludis
================

This file lists the major changes between versions. For a more detailed list
of every change, see the ChangeLog.

0.3.0 (in progress):
    * Lots of internal code cleanup.

    * Doxygen generated documentation is much cleaner. Documentation about
    configuration file formats is now provided.

    * The build directory for Portage format repositories is now configurable
    using a parameter named 'buildroot'.

    * .tar.Z files are now unpacked correctly.

    * The 'date' command in ebuild global scope now works with a warning,
    rather than being a hard failure.

    * --pretend --install now displays detailed counts ('1 upgrade, 3 new')
    rather than just a raw number.

    * As part of the test suite, various full installs of test packages are
    now performed.

    * Multiple eclass directories and multiple profile directories can now
    be specified for Portage format repositories. The 'eclassdir' and
    'profiledir' keys are now deprecated in favour of 'eclassdirs' and
    'profiledirs'.

    * Added a --list-vulnerabilities commandline option, mostly for use by
    tree maintainers.

    * A new repository format named "nothing" is available. It does not
    contain any packages, but supports a sync parameter to make automatically
    syncing other directories simpler.

    * Fetching is now handled via wrapper scripts. Support for file:/// URLs
    has been added.

    * If the user mirrors.conf file contains an entry with a mirror named '*',
    first try fetching everything from that location.

    * A warning is now emitted when dropping circular dependencies.

    * The merge / unmerge code is now written in C++ rather than bash, and the
    MD5 implementation is now internal rather than relying upon 'md5sum', which
    works around problems when upgrading libc.

    * A --dl-no-unnecessary-upgrades commandline option has been added.

    * xterm titles are now updated for syncing, similar to previous behaviour
    for installing.

0.2.5:
    * Syncing via Git is possible (git://, git+http://, git+ssh://).

    * A new mirrors.conf configuration file can be used by the user to specify
    favourite mirrors. It has the same format as thirdpartymirrors from the
    repository.

    * Error condition handling is improved in many places.

    * Versions can now include -try.

    * Initial work towards FreeBSD support has been started.

0.2.4:
    * An ebuild metadata generation bug has been fixed.

    * For Portage format repositories, the location of security advisories is
    now a configuration option.

0.2.3:
    * Added support for repository-level global and per-package USE forcing.

    * Added --repository, --category, and --package filter options for --list
      actions.

    * Added an eselect-based newsreader. Paludis now provides a reference
      implementation of GLEP 42.

    * Various bugfixes -- reinstalling glibc and coreutils should work now,
      amongst others.

0.2.2:
    * Deplist tags are now used for all package sets.

    * The --query output now includes a key explaining the mask symbols.

    * News items can now be delivered via repositories (GLEP 42).

    * Various sandbox issues have been fixed.

    * Various bugfixes.

0.2.1:
    * Build issues caused by trying to invoke sandbox from inside sandbox have
      been fixed.

    * The value of EAPI is now shown in the --install mask reasons.

    * User and repository defined package sets are supported.

    * The hook script interface has been enhanced. A hook script for logging
      important actions to paludis.log is included.

    * The --best-version output no longer includes the ::repository suffix.

    * VDB reading is more tolerant of missing and malformed files.

    * Using --query on a package set produces a better error.

    * Ebuilds using fetch restrict will now have pkg_nofetch called where
      appropriate.

0.2.0:
    Initial public release.
